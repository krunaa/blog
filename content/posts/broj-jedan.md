## Intro
Forever alone forever at home. I have unfortunately made so many good friends after ending up at the cemetery. Each friend deeply burried under the frozen earth. I have never had so many friends talk back to me while my head was laying on the cold ground. It was absolutely amazing.

I talked and they talked back, I reached and they reached back, pulling me into their cold and broken embrace. The hugs, the kisses, the creepy hisses have woken something deep inside of me. I have finally felt at home, at peace.

```python
def mama(a, b):
    return a + b
```
